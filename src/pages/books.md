<h2>Effective Java</h2>
<p>Many schools will teach you the basics of a language and then expect you to figure out the rest.  For example, I learned the basics of Java in school, but became an intermediate and advanced user after my internships and school projects.</p>
<p>I was lucky to take a class with this as a required reading.  The book covers Java best practices with topics ranging from generics, enums, exceptions, concurrency, and general programming.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Algorithms</h2>
<p>Having strong algorithms is an essential part of programming.  Users don't want to wait weeks for an algorithm to finish when the same job could be done in seconds.  This is the holy grail for algorithms.  Topics range from runtime analysis, sorting, dynamic programming, data structures, and many more.  It's a big book and there are many examples in pseudocode to learn from.</p>

<h2>Computer Organization and Design</h2>
<p>As a Computer Engineer I absolutely loved this book.  It covers the design of many essential parts of a computer such as caching schemes, memory organization, and pipelining.  The MIPS assembly language is used to demonstrate a 5-stage pipeline which helped me develop an intuition between how the code I write is actually executed on a computer.</p>

<h2>Computer Networking</h2>
<p>Computer Networks: A Top-Down Approach is a great introductory book to computer networks.  It's common for a program to access the internet.  Understanding each of the layers of the internet is essential in building these programs.</p>
