description: Learn what you should do after attending a career fair.

<h2>What now...?</h2>

<p>After two hours of bumbling around, trying to reach your target companies and maneuvering between your competition, you're exhausted. What good was the 5-10 minutes you spent spilling your guts to these recruiters when they simply instruct you to apply online and send you on your way? Yes, it can be discouraging going through all that effort to impress the recruiters and having them tell you that you should just apply online. Where was your invitation to interview with them? Fret not my friends.</p>

<p>Your efforts were definitely not for naught. If you felt even remotely confident that your conversation with a recruiter went really well use that confidence to your advantage. Hopefully you were able to obtain a business card or perhaps remembered the name of the person you spoke with. You should now be thinking about following up with the company to remind them of how well your chat went. Personally, this worked well for me with two companies in particular. I followed up with the person I spoke with at the career fair in a sincere email stating my interest in working for that company and how much I enjoyed our chat at the career fair. I heard back within a day and about a week later I was called in for an interview. Be assertive and remember the <strong>6 ARCHES</strong> I mentioned in my first <a target="blank_" href="http://www.csinterviews.com/internships-interviews-resumes-career-fairs-and-more">post</a>. These 6 guidelines will help you maintain lasting relationships with recruiters and people you work with.</p>

<h2>How did you get your first internship?</h2>

<p>My number one company at the time was Cisco Systems, Inc. I had gone to the career fair and spoken to a Cisco recruiter and handed him my application. I wasn't very confident because my resume was pretty standard for a sophomore student. No prior internships, the same programming projects as other computer engineering students, and a mediocre 3.4 gpa. About a week later I realized I didn't even apply online. They had specifically asked students to apply on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.umass.experience.com">www.umass.experience.com</a>. Just like that my shot at my top choice for an internship went down the drain. There was no way that I could just give up that easy! I looked up the contacts on umass.experience.com for Cisco and emailed one of the recruiters. As politely as I could I apologized for not applying online through the University portal and briefly explained how much I wanted to work for Cisco and why I felt I would be the perfect candidate. For the next two weeks I was in contact with that same recruiter and he eventually got me an interview with a hot-shot engineer all the way in California. Leave a comment below if you want to hear the rest of my tale.</p>

<h2>Moral of the story</h2>

<p>Don't give up! Keep up those applications because the possibilities are endless. Several job search websites that have worked for me are <a href="http://www.dice.com" target="_blank">dice.com</a>, <a href="http://www.indeed.com" target="_blank">indeed.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.internmatch.com" target="_blank">internmatch.com</a>. There are plenty more and you can even search for internships based on location. It's in your hands now and how much you want it will really make all the difference.</p>
