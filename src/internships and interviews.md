description: A general guide to building a resume and landing an interview.

<h2>How do I get an interview?</h2>

<p>Computer science is a very competitive field. How do you stand out, you might ask? Be proactive. Treat the job search process like one of your courses. You will have to dedicate a good amount of your time and effort if you want to find the right job. As a student you'll have to find your own ways of managing your time.</p>

<ul class="post-list">
<li><strong>Step 1:</strong></li>
<p>Build your resume.</p>
<li><strong>Step 2:</strong></li>
<p>Network. Do you have friends or family who work in the industry and can refer you to an inside connection to a company? Get business cards of people that you meet and don't be afraid to make conversation with random people!</p>
<li><strong>Step 3:</strong></li>
<p>Be persistent. Don't give up after just applying for a position. If you really want the job send a follow up email. Got a school career fair? GO TO IT! Meet the recruiters and show your interest in their company - and obviously show up having done your homework on the companies you plan to speak to.</p>
<li><strong>Step 4:</strong></li>
<p>Dress accordingly. When speaking to a recruiter in person you have to look like you are ready to take the job at that moment. Look sharp and well groomed. This shows you care and that you take it seriously.</p>
</ul>

<h2>The 6 supporting <b>ARCHES</b></h2>
<p>Be...</p>
<ul class="post-list">
<li><strong>Articulate:</strong></li> <p>When you speak, speak clearly. Don't mumble because you don't want to be wasting your time or the recruiters' by having to repeat something you've said. Being able to articulate your words proves good communication skills and ability to explain technical concepts so that someone non-technical can understand.</p>
<li><strong>Resourceful:</strong></li> <p>Prepare for every interview. Research the company, its' products and your interviewer. Sometimes the company will provide you with the name of your interviewer. It is always an advantage to know who your interviewer is. The minute you can relate yourself with that person take the opportunity to get on a personal level with him or her. Many candidates are selected because they were likeable and pleasant to work/speak with.</p>
<li><strong>Confident:</strong></li> <p>Be confident in yourself. If you are able to get an interview consider yourself one of the few. Getting that interview is the first step and it already proves the point that you have the skills they are looking for. If you sound confident the recruiter will likely be able to pick up your confidence and be assured that you are the candidate they are looking for.</p>
<li><strong>Honest:</strong></li> <p>Be yourself and don't lie or exaggerate your accomplishments. Especially don't put things on your resume you aren't comfortable with. A lot of companies go over your resume with you in detail and if you can't explain in depth the project you put down, game over.</p>
<li><strong>Enthusiastic:</strong></li> <p>Prove you want to work for the company. Bring up products you are interested in. Many companies will ask why do you want to work for them so be prepared to talk about the company itself. A good start is to talk about what you know and like about them.</p>
<li><strong>Sincere:</strong></li> <p>Please and thank you will get you far. It is a common child hood lesson yet still very relevant. Always thank your interviewer for his time and consideration. If you have a specific request or question be polite. I see a lot of students sending professional emails and they just read terrible. Your words can easily be misinterpreted and can be seen as rude if you aren't careful.</p>
</ul>

<h2>The Resume</h2>

<p>You need a great resume. Building your resume and perfecting it is without a doubt the most important key to getting your shot at a dream company. Google? Microsoft? Apple? You'll need a darn good resume to catch the attention of these big fishes.</p>

<p>Here's my own resume as an example. Why is this a good resume? I've had interviews with over 15 different companies and recruiting agencies within the last year. Seven of which, I've received an offer. Keep in mind that I conduct interviews for fun and for the experience so an offer is not always my goal. Managing your time during school is vital and often I've had to deny the next round of interviews.</p>

<h3>What do I put on my resume?</h3>

<p>The #1 eye catcher is putting down internships related to computer science. Typically these would go in the Relevant Experience section of your resume. Companies want to know if you would fit in their company culture and if you've had experience working for a company.</p>

<h3>But I only have Academic experience...</h3>
<img src="/static/images/KF5rpUO.jpg" />

<p>Great. Here’s your chance to show how you’re the best student academically. Put down class projects, outside of academic work (CS students should be working on their own projects that interest them). Outside projects prove you’re passionate about computer science. Companies want to hire someone who actually enjoys their profession. Try working with your close friends on a group project. This shows initiative, drive, and creativity. Group work is very important even if you happen to be a lone wolf/ninja coder. When you get far enough in the interview process you’ll be interviewing with people who you will potentially be working with should you get hired so they want to know if you will get a long.</p>

<h3>How long should it be?</h3>

<p>A lot of University career centers will tell you to always limit it to one page. The reasoning behind this is that when you attend a career fair recruiters don’t want to be holding more than one paper for each candidate nor do they want to have to flip over onto the next side of the page. They have a lot of resumes to look through so career centers advise you to limit it to one page. At this point in many undergraduate students’ careers there isn’t a whole lot to put on their resume so keeping it short and simple and highlighting your strengths is probably best. Once you have a lot of experience under your belt and truly feel that every bit of information will benefit your job search then you can expand to more than one page. </p>

<h3>There is too much white space on my resume. How do I fill it up?</h3>

<p>Don’t be afraid to put down all relevant academic projects from your courses. You wrote a simple program in Java for your data structures class? Great. Put it down but make sure you have a really good understanding of the entire project and that you can clearly explain the different parts of it. For example, your project was to write a series of Java classes to parse a file and store the parsed data into data structures like hash tables. If you put that on your resume make sure you understand what hash tables are, what they are used for etc… Make sure you know how you would parse or even take a file as input to a Java program.</p>

<h2>The Career Fair</h2>

<p>Have an elevator pitch ready, a 30 second introduction to yourself that you give to the recruiter at a company table. <a target="blank_" href="http://www.engineering.cornell.edu/academics/graduate/upload/Final-MENG-Elevator-Speech.pdf">Here is a great resource from Cornell on how to make an exceptional elevator speech.</a></p>

<p>Here is my elevator pitch I wrote for my junior writing class as an example...</p>
<img src="/static/images/DMaqV7v.jpg" />
<p>Make a list of the companies you want to talk to and order them by priority. If you’re confident go to your top company to make a great first impression while the recruiter is still fresh and hasn’t been bogged down by hundreds of conversations with students. If you aren’t, then save them for last while you warm up on your lower priority companies. RESEARCH is a must. Write facts down about the companies you plan to talk to. This will greatly help you bring up some talking points during the conversation.</p>

<p>USE resume paper. You can get it from staples – it’s thicker and it stands out more. Enough said. Just do it.</p>

<p>Dress sharp. Look good.</p>
